# Deep-Learning-GAN-Deep-Fakes
This project is done in python on Google Collab. I make two neural networks using a GAN to generate deep fake images of cats and dogs from an Oxford database. 

# Google Collab
Google Collab is a very useful tool for any and all deep learning projects. Instead of using youe CPU and or GPU like jupyter notebook, you access googles powerful GPU for free to train any of your models.
